We’d like to invite you to the event we are hosting as part of Leeds digital Festival.

It’s a celebration of **neurodiversity in tech**. There will be a series of lightning talks, followed by an ‘**Ask Me Anything**’ panel. Save the date **30th September 12 noon**.

We'll be LIVE on this site (just below), and also on [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/events/celebratingneurodiversityintech-paneldiscussion/) and [YouTube Live](https://youtu.be/pUxCRAmYgfY).

Improving diversity and inclusion are high on everyone’s agenda. There are many roles in digital and tech that neurodiverse people can excel at and cognitive diversity in problem solving is a proven asset. We’ll be hearing from neurodiverse people and experts in the field through a series of short case studies and talks including some quick win changes everyone can make. 

This is a call to action for all forward thinking organisations in Leeds and beyond to embrace neurodiversity in our recruitment process and working habits.
